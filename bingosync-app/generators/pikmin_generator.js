//Version 1.4 of Pikmin Bingo

//Changes from 1.3
//Swapped Pilot's Seat and Zirconium Rotor because Zirconium Rotor is harder but was placed lower
//Puffy Blowhogs decreased from 3 to 2 because 3 seems a bit much for level 16
//Added defeat 6 Shearwigs
//Added build 3 bridges in Distant Spring
//Added collect an Armored Cannon Beetle corpse
//Added make Olimar lose all his health
//Moved a few goals around by 1 or 2 values to guarantee certain types of tasks
//Changed Puffstool with bomb rocks to hit Puffstool with a bomb rock
//Moved Beady Long Legs without yellows from 21 to 13 because it's the standard strategy these days
//Moved Mamuta and Goolix from 13 to 21 because resetting days adds a ton of time
//Moved 3 Burrowing Snagrets from 17 to 23 because it's more fitting there; might move it again because it's in FoH
//Changed all 5 stone walls in FN to 3 walls and moved it from 23 to 17 because it takes 2 days otherwise
//Water Dumples decreased from 8 to 7 because there are only 7 in front
//Wollywogs decreased from 6 to 4 because there are only 4 in FN and it's a level 2 task, also changed to regular Wollywogs
//Added defeat 3 Yellow Wollywogs
//Added lifeguarding task because it's a cool mechanic few people ever use

//Changes from 1.2
//Fixed a glitch that could cause two of a goal to appear in the same row on the same card
//Added getting a 20-pellet of each color
//Added maximum of 100 total pikmin alive task
//Decreased the counts required for certain "Have X Pikmin" tasks because they took overwhelmingly long
//Moved stuff for general balance

//Changes from 1.1
//Moved Puffstool with bomb rocks from 14 to 23 because it's ridiculous

//Changes from 1.0
//Added Pellet Posies task
//Added picking a flowered Pikmin
//Added Bulbear with bomb rocks
//Added Puffstool with bomb rocks
//Added grubdogs task
//Added Swooping Snitchbug task
//Moved stuff for general balance
