                        Bingosync is a web application that lets people collaboratively work on
                        "bingo boards" for speedrunning games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you create a bingosync room from the main page of
                        <a href="http://bingosync.com">bingosync.com</a>,
                        you will get a unique URL that you can share with other people to let
                        them join your room. When multiple people are in the same room,
                        the squares on the bingoboard are synchronized between them in
                        real time. This lets you plan and keep track of bingo progress together.
                        You can left click on a goal to change its color publicly or right click
                        on a goal to "star" it privately. You can use starring to plan your goals
                        without other players seeing.

                                        or diagonal. You can play in the same room as other racers to see

                                        a fixed time limit.

                                        by your opponent, excluding diagonals, to "flip" that square to
                                        your color&mdash; even if you don't have the goal that's being stolen.

                        New generators and generator variants are welcome from anyone! To add a new
                        generator, just send me:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The generator or goal list you'd like to use</li>
                            <li>The name you'd like (for the room creation dropdown)</li>
                            <li>The abbreviated name you'd like, ideally no more than 10-12 characters
                                (for the rooms list)</li>
                        </ol>
                        To update an existing generator, send me the new generator or goal list you'd
                        like and make sure that you have permission from whoever requested the old
                        version of that generator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're just starting out and need to make a goal list, there are two
                        main ways to make one:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make an SRL-style goal list with 25 difficulty tiers.
                                (<a href="https://pastebin.com/Ue2wcMcY">example</a>)</li>
                            <li>Make a simple list of just the goal names that you want.
                                (<a href="https://pastebin.com/J8aRHmrM">example</a>)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An SRL-style goal list takes more work but can produce more balanced boards.
                        The generator will try to use 1 goal from each difficulty tier and arrange
                        them so that every row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same difficulty
                        value. If 2 goals have one of the same "types" then it will refuse to put
                        them in the same row. This lets you keep incompatible or broken goal pairs
                        from appearing together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A generator made with a simple goal list will randomly choose goals from
                        the list without regard for conflicts or synergy. This list can just be a
                        pastebin with each goal name on a separate line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your generator doesn't fit into one of these categories or has special
                        requirements, get in contact with me and we can work it out.

                        You can make a room with a specific custom board without creating a generator
                        by using the "Custom&nbsp;(Advanced)" game type. You can then paste a 25 element
                        JSON list containing the goals for your card into the text box. Here's an
                        example list: <a href="https://pastebin.com/kqGNx5A8">pastebin.com/kqGNx5A8</a>

                    <p>
                        The custom board mode can only be used to make a board with a specific list
                        of 25 goals. It won't randomize the card for you like a regular generator.
                        If you want to have a randomized card you either need to randomize it yourself
                        before creating the room or make a regular generator instead.
